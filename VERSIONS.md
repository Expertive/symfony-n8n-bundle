# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Symfony 8.0 Support**: Full compatibility with Symfony 8.0
- **PHP 8.4 Support**: Tested and verified with PHP 8.4
- **Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline**: Matrix testing across all supported PHP and Symfony versions
- **Full RequestMethod Support**: HTTP client now respects `getN8nRequestMethod()` from payload (GET, POST_JSON, POST_FORM, PUT, PATCH)

### Changed
- **Minimum PHP Version**: Now requires PHP 8.2+ (previously 8.1)
- **Route Attribute Namespace**: Updated from deprecated `Annotation\Route` to `Attribute\Route`
- **PHPUnit Configuration**: Updated for PHPUnit 10/11 compatibility
- **Stricter Deprecation Testing**: Enhanced deprecation detection in tests
- **N8nRequest**: Added `requestMethod` property for proper HTTP method handling

### Fixed
- **Memory Leak in RequestTracker**: Fixed missing `completeRequest()` call on successful `send()` - requests were never removed from tracker causing memory growth
- **RequestMethod Ignored**: `N8nPayloadInterface::getN8nRequestMethod()` is now properly used by `N8nHttpClient` to set HTTP method and Content-Type

### Breaking Changes
- PHP 8.1 is no longer supported
- Symfony 8.0 requires PHP 8.4+ (Symfony framework requirement)

## [1.1.0] - 2025-07-14

### Added
- **N8nResponse DTO**: New response object for type-safe response handling
- **HTTP Proxy Support**: Enterprise-ready proxy configuration with environment variable support
- **Enhanced Service Configuration**: Improved DI container integration with proper interface aliases
- **Type-Safe Response Handling**: Replaced array returns with proper N8nResponse objects

### Changed
- **N8nClient Interface**: Updated to return N8nResponse objects instead of arrays
- **Response Processing**: Enhanced response handling with `isSuccess()`, `getUuid()`, `getResponse()` methods
- **Configuration Structure**: Added proxy configuration options to bundle configuration
- **Health Check**: Enhanced with proxy support for enterprise environments

### Fixed
- **DemoController**: Fixed array access error when using N8nResponse objects
- **Type Safety**: Improved type declarations throughout the codebase
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced exception management and error reporting

### Technical Improvements
- Better encapsulation with proper response object methods
- Consistent code formatting across the entire codebase
